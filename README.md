# Account-Management-System
Part I:  Given an array of ints, recursively determine how many times 17 appears in the array.  public in find17(int [] n, int index)  You will start looking in the array at the position index.     Part II:  Design a class Account that has an int ID, a double balance, and a String name.  The id, balance, and name all must be private.  Control any needed access with methods.  The program will have the ability to check the balance, withdraw, deposit.  Enter a -1 for the ID to cancel running the program.  You will create an array of 5 Accounts with the following information:  ID           Balance          Name  1            400                Homer Simpson  2            325                George Jetson  3            1050              Fred Flintstone  4            60                  Peter Griffin  5            200                Professor Utonium     You will hard code this data into an array of 5 Accounts.     Allow the user to keep checking their balance, withdrawing or depositing money until they wish to quit (enter 4).  After they quit allow them to enter another user number and the process begins again.    Constraints: Do not allow anything but an int for the id and do not allow anything but a double for the balance.  Check to make sure the ID is valid based on the above data entered.
